# =======================
# API BASE URL CONFIGURATION
# =======================

# Used by Server Actions within Next.js environment (running in FE Docker container).
# Since FE and BE run in the same Docker network, the hostname used here is the backend service name
# as defined in docker-compose.yml ("be").
#
# Example: fetch from server action => fetch("http://be:3000/api/...")
NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_BASE_URL=http://be:3000/api

# Used by Client Actions running in the browser.
# The browser CANNOT resolve Docker service names ("be"), so we must use a publicly accessible
# domain/host (e.g., localhost or real domain).
#
# Example: fetch from client action => fetch("http://localhost:3000/api/...")
# For production deployment, REPLACE "localhost:3000" with your public domain (e.g., https://api.example.com)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_BASE_URL_FOR_CLIENT=http://localhost:3000/api

# AUTH CONFIGURATION
# =======================

# Secret key for JWT signing/verification on backend.
# MUST be kept secure and never committed to public repositories.
